# CS2103T Team Project [W08-4]

* This is **a brownfield project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Can be used by canteen vendors in NUS to manage their supplies and suppliers.
  * Can be used as a barebones address book as well.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Salesy_) used for managing suppliers via contacts as well as supplies.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Salesy` because our team wanted to up the sales of canteen vendors by allowing them to be more efficient using our management applicaiton.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Salesy Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w08-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
