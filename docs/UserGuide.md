Salesy is a desktop app for helping food vendors manage details of their clients and suppliers, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast and remember the commands well, Salesy can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
